## 1. variables & mutability

- `variables` are immutable by default but you can decalre `mut` to convert to mutable.

- the most difference between `variable` and `constance` is `constance` always immutable but another can convert.

- rustaceans say that the first variable is `shadowed` by the scond, which means that the second variable's value is what appears when the variable is used. Notice, we can `shadow` a variable by using the same variable's name and repeating the use of `let` keyword.
